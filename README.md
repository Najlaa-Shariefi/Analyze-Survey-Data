Analyzing Udacity Nanodegree Survey Data

This is the second project in the Data Foundations Nanodegree which required us to conduct an analysis using Microsoft Excel to parse the data of actual survey results from past students. All analysis and visualizations were conducted in Excel and presented in PowerPoint.

In this project, I had used statistics and Excel to summarize the results of a survey sent to Udacity Nanodegree program alumni. I had cleaned the data, adjust for common data issues, used statistics and visualizations to explore the data, and communicated my findings with data visualizations. The first project in the Data Foundations Nanodegree is an analysis using Microsoft Excel to parse the data of actual survey results from past students. All analysis and visualizations were conducted in Excel and presented in PowerPoint.
